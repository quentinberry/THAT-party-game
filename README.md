# THAT-party-game

## What is it about?

The best drinking game world wide

# What do I need to install?

For running this Project, you'll need these installed:

* JavaScript
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [React native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) (ideally version 17.0.2)
* [expo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) 
* An IDE of your choice

# How to run?

Just make sure that you are at content root in your terminal. Then type: `expo start`. Now you have the option to scan the QR-code that is being printed in the terminal, and open the app on your devie (Expo app needs to be installed on our phone). Otherwise open the localhost to show changes on web. 

While the app is running, you can type `a` to open the app in Android studio (intallation needed) to emulate an Android app.
Same thing for ios, but you need to type `i` in chat and need Xcode installed.
